# Outcomes Based on Goals

## Overview of Project
The purpose of the followimg analysis is to allow Louise to take a deeper dive into the data and take a closer look at campaign outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals. This will allow her to determine patterns of successful campaigns she can then take and replicate for future fundraisers. 


## Analysis and Challenges
In the following analysis we took the theather category and plays subcatecory and determined which were most successful in any given month. In addition, of the theatre/play fundraisers, we determined the percentage successful,failed and canceled based on the fundraising goal. We created two pivot charts that showed trends by launch date which allows us to determine that the month of May was by the far the most sucessful in comparison to all other months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In the analysis based on launch date we took theatre category campaigns within the subcategory of plays and used a pivot chart to determine which month was the most successful. After creating the chart and evaluating the data,we can determine that the month of May was indeed the most sucessful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In the analysis based on goals, we again took theatre category campaigns within the play subcategory and used a pivot chart to determine what goal ranges are the most succesful. In this case, after evaluating the data, we can determine that fundraisers with a goal of less than $1000 have 76% success rate. A close second was fundraisers with a range of $35,000 to $39,999 with 67% success rate. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The COUNTIFS formula although extremely valuable in this analysis posed a difficulty in that the ranges have to be precisely formatted in order to provide accurate results. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Two conclusions that can be drawn from our outcomes based on launch date analysis is that the month of May is by far the month that is the most successful for fundraisers. Interestingly, the month of May also has the highest percentage failed with 52%. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Based on the outcomes based on goals analysis, we can determine that fundraisers with a goal of less than $1000 have a higher success rate. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
In order to have a more wholestic analysis, it would be ideal to look at other types of theatre fundraisers outside of the plays subcategory and compare the results. In addition, it would be helpful to include the number of backers in the outcomes based on goals analysis to allow us to see if an increase in backers results in more successful campaigns.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A possible analysis would be to compare the theatre/plays and see if there is a correlation betweeen the amount of backers and what they pledge. Does more backers and smaller pledges equal to a higher rate of success? We could then create a scatter chart to compare dollar amounts of pledges vs number of backers.
