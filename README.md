# An analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
The following analysis includes descriptive statistics that will be helpful in determining the most successful types of campaigns along with the average successful pledge. This will help better align your goals to bringing together a successful campaign. What we can gather from the analysis is that theatre campaigns specifically narrowed down to plays in May have greater success overall.  In addition, setting a goal with a median of $3000 seems to be the most successful and is achieved more so than those with a goal above $5000.
